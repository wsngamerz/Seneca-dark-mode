# Seneca-dark-mode

seneca dark mode atm will be a css script which you have to inject into the website yourself at first but soon, i will be able to compile a chrome extension for it.

Add this piece of code to the bottom of the body tag to apply the styles.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://wsngamerz.github.io/Seneca-dark-mode/seneca.dark.css">
```

Developed and tested on chrome, may not work on other browsers
